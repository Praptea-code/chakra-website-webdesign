                    The home page of Rolex website starts with a video which made the
                    homepage really attractive so it was concluded that the homepage of
                    Chakra should also start with a video. The nav bar of Rolex was not
                    really as per our liking as it didnot have easy access to other
                    pages which in our opinion decreases the user friendliness. So, we
                    decided to put easy access to every other page in our nav bar
                    promoting a user friendly website. While scrolling we found that
                    Rolex's navbar didnot have sticky property but as we kept scrolling
                    and came across the next window the nav bar of Rolex's website
                    changed and that particular nav bar after the first window was
                    sticky.Therefore, after taking things in consideration we decided to
                    give sticky property to navbar and also used javascript to remove
                    the logo from the next window as it took alot of space.

                    Watches Nepal had a specific section in their homepage which
                    elaborated the highlights of their brand. This idea was very likable
                    because a customer knowing about the highlights about a brand might
                    convince the customer to buy from their brand. So, we also decided
                    to make this a part of our homepage.

                    Titan features a section highlighting their best selling products
                    which makes it easier for users to know about popular items. We came
                    to conclusion that keeping this in our website doesnt have any
                    negative aspect but only positive aspects so we kept best selling
                    section in our homepage as well. The product cards in both designs
                    are visually focused, displaying images, product names, and prices
                    prominently. Additionally, both websites adopt a clean and minimal
                    layout, ensuring the design does not distract the users.

                    The Titan website's footer has a clean and minimal layout including
                    everything that is necessary. Therefore we took Titan as our main
                    reference for footer part. We also added the copyright symbol in our
                    website footer because it informs visitors that the content is
                    protected by copyright law. This protects the website owner's
                    intellectual property and prevents unauthorized use of their
                    content.

                    After the product page when we clicked on a particular product in
                    Daraz, we noticed that the specifications of the object were not
                    side by side with the object. We had to scroll down for the
                    specifications. This didn't seem user friendly to us so we decided
                    to change this and put the specifications side by side with the
                    object in our Chakra website.
